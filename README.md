# hello-world
Not sure what this is but there is a first time for everything
//Craig David seven days//
I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
#She phoned said, "Hey, boy, come on right around."#
//So I knock at the door..
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
Chorus
Saying why were you creeping around late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
When I returned Jacuzzi's turned on
{Can you fill me in?}
